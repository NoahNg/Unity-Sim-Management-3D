# Unity-Sim-Management-3D
This game was made by me as part of an assignment in my last year at Wintec with Unity (language used: C#)

In order to play this game, you need to have Unity installed. 
After having installed Unity, please download 'GameFiles.zip', unzip it and run the file called 'My project.exe'.

I could not upload the Unity game files since they're too big for the repository.
